+# üìä Dynamic Portfolio Allocation under Uncertainty

This project implements and compares dynamic portfolio optimization methods for allocating wealth between risky and a risk-free asset over multiple periods. 
It explores both analytical and approximate solutions under different investor utility functions, including log and CRRA utilities.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Objective**: Determine optimal portfolio weights over a finite investment horizon in the presence of uncertainty.
- **Frameworks Used**:
  - Monte Carlo simulation
  - Convex optimization via CVXPY
  - Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP)
- **Key Features**:
  - Exact dynamic programming with log utility and multi-asset convex optimization 
  - Approximate dynamic programming with a single risky asset, CRRA utility, and cubic interpolation
  - Wealth grid construction and policy extraction
---

## üìå Modeling Assumptions

- The market is assumed to be **frictionless**, with no transaction costs, slippage, or liquidity constraints.
- Risk-free and risky assets are perfectly divisible.

## üìà Key Results

- Demonstrates how optimal asset allocations change over time and across wealth levels.
- Highlights the performance of approximate dynamic programming versus exact methods.
- Offers a blueprint for extending the ADP to multi-asset, multi-period portfolio problems.
